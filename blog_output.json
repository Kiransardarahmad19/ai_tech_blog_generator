But not all data is created equal—you need to divide it wisely. Enter *Train, Validation, and Test* datasets, the three cousins that must never mix. Confused? Let’s break it down in simple terms.  \n\n### What Are Train, Validation, and Test Datasets?  \n- **Train Dataset**: This is the star of the show. It’s the data your model learns from. Think of it as the textbook your model studies to understand patterns and relationships.  \n- **Validation Dataset**: This is the practice test. It helps you fine-tune your model by checking how well it performs on unseen data during training.  \n- **Test Dataset**: This is the final exam. It evaluates your model’s performance after training is complete, giving you an unbiased measure of how well it will perform in the real world.  \n\n### Why Can’t You Mix Them?  \nMixing these datasets is like cheating on an exam:  \n\n- **Train and Test Mixing**: If your model sees the test data during training, it “cheats” by memorizing the answers instead of learning patterns. This leads to *overfitting*, where the model performs well on training data but fails miserably on new data.  \n- **Validation and Test Mixing**: Using the test data for validation inflates your model’s performance metrics, making it seem better than it actually is.  \n\n### How to Split Your Data  \nA common split is 70% train, 15% validation, and 15% test, but this depends on your dataset size. The key is to ensure the test dataset remains untouched until the very end.  \n\n### Why Does This Matter?  \nProper splitting ensures your model generalizes well to new, unseen data. It’s the difference between building a model that works in the real world and one that’s just good at memorizing answers.  \n\nSo, the next time you’re training an ML model, remember: keep your cousins separate! Your model—and your results—will thank you.",
